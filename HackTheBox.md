# **HackTheBox**
Here is where you can find all notes taken throughout the duration of the course. Feel free to use, edit, and modify notes as you see fit.

The goal with these notes is for none of them to be useless information, such as “nmap is written in C, C++, Python, and Lua”, rather, “nmap is used to check firewall settings”. They should all be notes which you could utilize during a pentest, whether looking at the legal, ethical, or technical side of things. When in doubt, write more than less. You can always search for what you are looking for. It is harder to go back in HTB and find what you are looking for, then just CTRL+F it.

\*Make sure that you place your notes in the corresponding directory.

# **Fun Calculations**
## **HTB CPTS**
HTB CPTS is predicted (by HTB) to take 43, 8 hour days. This means, in total, it is predicted that the course will take **344 hours** to complete. One should only attempt this course if they are willing to put in the time necessary for completion. At the final certification of the exam, one must find at least 12/14 flags and write a professional-grade report, often lasting 100 or more pages. This exam is to be taken over the course of 10 days, which many have found to be the perfect amount of time.
## **HTB BB**
HTB BB is predicted (by HTB) to take 18, 8 hour days. This means, in total, it is predicted that the course will take **144 hours** to complete. Although this is substantially less than the HTB CPTS, it is still a substantial amount of time, and one must commit total effort for a prolonged period of time in order to complete this course, and penultimate certification.
